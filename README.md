# webstream-on-webbrowser

Do you use to cast fancy webcam streamings (ie. using OBS virtual camera)? Do you want to mix your cam steam image along with your screen share in a Web Meeting tool? 

Then probably faced the issue that the frame rate and quality is super low when you try to share the screen with others (I'm referring to sharing OBS output as sharing desktop or application window, not just casting your image as virtual cam).

In some cases web meeting tools (such as in Google Meet) allow you to share "high quality" content if you share a "browser tab" instead "sharing your desktop".

In order to take advantage of that you can get the OBS virtual camera output in a web tab but just downloading this HTLM locally and open it... that's it.

Enjoy your fancy webinars!
